## üìå Why Fradium?

In the growing world of decentralized finance, users interact with thousands of blockchain addresses and smart contracts every day, many of which may be unverified, anonymous, or even malicious. Traditional wallets and explorers offer limited protection or context, putting users at risk of fraud, scams, and security breaches. Fradium addresses this challenge by providing a secure, AI-powered platform with community-backed reports to detect threats in real time. Supporting multiple blockchains, Fradium enables users to analyze, report, and transact safely across networks with confidence. Every transaction is checked before execution, giving users full protection and peace of mind as they navigate Web3.

## Buiild and Run Yourself

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Install the [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx) v0.27.0. If the IC SDK is already installed with an old version, install 0.27.0 with [`dfxvm`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dev-tools-overview#dfxvm).
- [ ] Confirm the IC SDK has been installed with the correct version with `dfx --version`.
- [ ] On **macOS**, an `llvm` version that supports the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is required. This is because the `zstd` crate (used, for example, to decode `base64+zstd`-encoded responses from Solana's [`getAccountInfo`](https://solana.com/de/docs/rpc/http/getaccountinfo)) depends on LLVM during compilation. The default LLVM bundled with Xcode does not support `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. To fix this, install the [Homebrew version](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/llvm), using `brew install llvm`.

Begin by opening a terminal window.

### Install MOPS

[Install](https://docs.mops.one/quick-start#2-install-mops-cli) the MOPS package
manager, e.g., by running

```bash
curl -fsSL cli.mops.one/install.sh | sh
```

### Install cargo:

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Install Bitcoin Locally with Regtest

Fradium includes Bitcoin functionality. For testing and development, you can run a local Bitcoin regtest instance, allowing you to mine blocks instantly, issue fake BTC, and test transfers securely.

To set up your local Bitcoin regtest environment, follow this official guide:

üëâ [Install bitcoin on local machine](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/build-on-btc/btc-dev-env)

The guide walks you through:

- Installing bitcoind
- Creating bitcoin.conf and bitcoin_data directory
- Running bitcoind

Once bitcoind is running successfully on your local machine, you can proceed to set up and deploy the application.

### Setup Application:

- Start local Internet Computer replica

  ```sh
   cd fradium/
   dfx start --clean --background
  ```

- Deploy applications

  ```sh
   dfx deploy
  ```

- Run build fradium token script

  ```sh
   chmod +x ./scripts/build.fradium_token.sh
   ./script/build.fradium_token.sh
  ```
