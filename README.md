## üéØ Why Fradium?

Fradium addresses urgent challenges in Web3 security and adoption:

- Despite ranking **#3 globally in crypto adoption** with **356% YoY growth**, Indonesia lost **$2.5B to scams**, saw **332K wallet drainer victims**, and over **$40.9B** was sent to illicit addresses.
- These risks are driven by **low blockchain literacy** and lack of awareness around smart contract and wallet vulnerabilities.
- Traditional wallets and explorers provide **limited protection or context**, leaving users exposed to phishing, scams, and malicious addresses.

Our solution introduces **Fradium**, a fully on-chain security and analytics platform that provides real-time address analysis, transaction insights, and AI-powered threat detection across multiple blockchains. With decentralized reporting, tokenized incentives, and transparent governance, Fradium empowers users to transact with confidence while actively contributing to securing the Web3 ecosystem.

## ü§ñ How the Fradium AI Threat Detection Works

Fradium's core security layer is powered by advanced machine learning models that analyze blockchain addresses in real-time to detect potential threats, scams, and malicious activity.

### Multi-Chain AI Models

- **Bitcoin Detection**: Analyzes UTXO patterns, transaction clustering, and spending behaviors
- **Ethereum Detection**: Examines smart contract interactions, ERC-20 token flows, and gas usage patterns
- **Solana Detection**: Evaluates program interactions, token account behaviors, and validator patterns

### Key AI Features

- **On-Chain Inference**: ML models run directly on Internet Computer canisters for trustless predictions
- **Hybrid Processing**: Optimized architectures for each blockchain's unique characteristics
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Instant threat assessment before transaction execution
- **Continuous Learning**: Models improve through community feedback and new threat data

### Technical Highlights

| Component            | Technology                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **ML Framework**     | Neural Networks (MLP) via ONNX         |
| **Inference Engine** | tract-onnx on Internet Computer        |
| **Model Training**   | Python (scikit-learn)                  |
| **Deployment**       | Embedded ONNX models in Wasm canisters |

The AI system processes thousands of behavioral features per address, including transaction patterns, timing analysis, amount distributions, and network relationships to provide accurate threat assessments with minimal false positives.

## üöÄ Build and Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Install the [IC SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/index.mdx) v0.27.0. If the IC SDK is already installed with an old version, install 0.27.0 with [`dfxvm`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dev-tools-overview#dfxvm).
- [ ] Confirm the IC SDK has been installed with the correct version with `dfx --version`.
- [ ] On **macOS**, an `llvm` version that supports the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is required. This is because the `zstd` crate (used, for example, to decode `base64+zstd`-encoded responses from Solana's [`getAccountInfo`](https://solana.com/de/docs/rpc/http/getaccountinfo)) depends on LLVM during compilation. The default LLVM bundled with Xcode does not support `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. To fix this, install the [Homebrew version](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/llvm), using `brew install llvm`.

Begin by opening a terminal window.

### Install MOPS

[Install](https://docs.mops.one/quick-start#2-install-mops-cli) the MOPS package
manager, e.g., by running

```bash
curl -fsSL cli.mops.one/install.sh | sh
```

### Install cargo:

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Install Bitcoin Locally with Regtest

Fradium includes Bitcoin functionality. For testing and development, you can run a local Bitcoin regtest instance, allowing you to mine blocks instantly, issue fake BTC, and test transfers securely.

To set up your local Bitcoin regtest environment, follow this official guide:

üëâ [Install bitcoin on local machine](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/build-on-btc/btc-dev-env)

The guide walks you through:

- Installing bitcoind
- Creating bitcoin.conf and bitcoin_data directory
- Running bitcoind

Once bitcoind is running successfully on your local machine, you can proceed to set up and deploy the application.

### Setup Application:

- Start local Internet Computer replica

  ```sh
   cd fradium/
   dfx start --clean --background
  ```

- Deploy applications

  ```sh
   dfx deploy
  ```

- Run build fradium token script

  ```sh
   chmod +x ./scripts/build.fradium_token.sh
   ./script/build.fradium_token.sh
  ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
