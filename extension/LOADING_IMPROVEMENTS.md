# Loading Improvements for Home Component

## Problem Analysis

The original `Home.tsx` component had a significant issue where token balances would display as 0 for 1-3 minutes before showing actual values. This was caused by:

1. **Race Condition**: `loadWalletData()` was called before `networkValues` and `tokenPrices` were fully loaded
2. **Asynchronous Loading**: `fetchNetworkBalances()` in `walletContext` required time to:
   - Fetch balances from blockchain networks
   - Fetch token prices from CoinGecko API
   - Calculate USD values
3. **Initial State**: `networkValues` started with 0 values, and balance calculation depended on unavailable data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Loading States
- **Individual Token Loading**: Each token now shows a loading spinner when its balance is being fetched
- **Main Network Value Loading**: The main balance display shows loading state when overall balances are loading
- **Wallet Status Loading**: Enhanced wallet status to show "Fetching balances..." when appropriate
- **Token List Loading**: Shows loading state when no tokens are available but balances are being fetched

### 2. Smart Loading Detection
```typescript
// Check if balances are still loading
const checkBalancesLoading = useCallback(() => {
  const hasZeroBalances = Object.values(networkValues).some(value => value === 0);
  const hasPrices = Object.keys(tokenPrices).length > 0;
  const hasWallet = !!userWallet;
  
  // If we have wallet and prices but still have zero balances, consider it loading
  const shouldShowLoading = hasWallet && hasPrices && hasZeroBalances;
  
  setIsBalancesLoading(shouldShowLoading);
}, [networkValues, tokenPrices, userWallet]);
```

### 3. Individual Token Loading Logic
```typescript
// Determine if this specific token is still loading
const isTokenLoading = usdValue === 0 && tokenPrice > 0 && Object.keys(tokenPrices).length > 0;
```

### 4. Enhanced UI Components
- **TokenBalanceLoader**: Reusable loading component with spinner and "Loading..." text
- **Main Value Loading**: Large loading spinner for the main balance display
- **Header Loading Indicator**: Small loading indicator in the Tokens header
- **Empty State Handling**: Proper loading states for when no tokens are available

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users now see loading indicators instead of confusing 0 values
2. **Clear Feedback**: Loading states clearly indicate when data is being fetched
3. **Reduced Confusion**: No more wondering why balances are 0 for extended periods
4. **Professional Appearance**: Loading spinners make the app feel more responsive and polished

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Added `isBalancesLoading` state for overall balance loading
- Added `isLoading` property to individual `TokenBalance` objects
- Enhanced loading detection logic with proper dependency tracking

### Loading Detection Logic
- Checks if wallet is loaded
- Checks if token prices are available
- Checks if any network values are still 0
- Determines appropriate loading states for different UI elements

### UI Components
- Loading spinners with consistent styling (`border-[#9BE4A0]` color)
- Loading text with appropriate opacity (`text-white/50`)
- Responsive loading states that adapt to different data availability scenarios

## Usage

The loading improvements are automatically applied when:
1. The component first renders
2. Wallet data is being fetched
3. Network balances are being calculated
4. Token prices are being retrieved

No additional configuration is required - the loading states will automatically appear and disappear based on data availability.

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. **Skeleton Loading**: Placeholder UI elements while data loads
2. **Progressive Loading**: Load critical data first, then secondary data
3. **Caching**: Store balance data locally to reduce loading times on subsequent visits
4. **Background Refresh**: Update balances in the background without blocking UI
